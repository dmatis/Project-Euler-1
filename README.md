# Project-Euler

Project Euler is a collection of computer-science/math problems that are posted online at:
https://projecteuler.net/

The way I have structured the project, just pull the code and just import that as an existing project into eclipse/intellij

This project currently contains about 50 solved problems. 
Soon to be completely commented with explanations

Enjoy
